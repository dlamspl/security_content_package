  This project gives you access to your repository of Analytic Stories,
  security guides that provide background on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs),
  mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework, the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain, and CIS Controls.
  They include Splunk searches, machine learning algorithms and
  Splunk Phantom playbooks (where available)â€”all designed to work together to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.
